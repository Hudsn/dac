default_description: |-
 This rule is meant to identify evil foozles based on the 'is_evil' field in the foozle data structure.
default_classification: malicious
analysis_steps: |-
  Ensure the widget responsible for the foozle is behaving as expected. 
  Check that the foozle that was flagged is not a custom and verified foozle in the environment by looking in the widget-foozle registry.
  If this foozle appears to be unverified and is generating unexpected or unauthorized activity, escalate for immediate removal of this foozle.
false_positives: |- 
  The foozle parsing engine can incorrectly identify in-house custom foozles as evil.
  If this foozle appears to be performing legitimate activity and its metadata matches that of the widget-foozle registry, this is likely a false positive.
